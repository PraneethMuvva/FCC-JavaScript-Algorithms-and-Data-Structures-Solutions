# FCC-JavaScript-Algorithms-and-Data-Structures-Solutions

Here are my solutions to the projects for the freeCodeCamp JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures certification. The problems and test cases can 
be viewed [here](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures-projects/). The 
certificate can be verified [here](https://www.freecodecamp.org/certification/praneethm/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures).
